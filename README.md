# DualSpeakerGalaxyS8

As all we know, (Galaxy S8 & S8+) only has one speaker at the bottom,
thats why the sound output is quite underwhelmed when compare to other latest flagships from HTC or even Apple iPhone 7 which using its earpiece speaker as secondary output

Coming from that concept, this mod will allow you to use your earpiece as second speaker as well, creating pseudo-stereo output in result and should give better experience inplaying any audio
